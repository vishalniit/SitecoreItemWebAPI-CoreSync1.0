# SitecoreItemWebAPI-CoreSync1.0
I enhanced the Sitecore Item WebAPI 1.2 to include few new features because Item Web API does not support create the versioned (Language or Numbered) item. The media item support is also not great with Item Web API. The biggest support I am looking was, what If, if I want to create an Item while retaining the Item ID on the new Sitecore System. Such can only happen through two ways in Sitecore one is Plain Serialization or itâ€™s another popular derivative which is Sitecore packaging.
Now to overcome these challenges I decide to extend the Item Web API in such a manner so that it can do lot more than what it made for. I hope community like this extention.

What is Pre-Requisite ?
 You need to installed Sitecore Item Web API 1.2 if you are using Sitecore version prior to 7.2. If you are using Sitecore 7.2 then Item Web API is part and parcel of Sitecore Package.
 
How to Use from this GitHub?
 Download the whole project to your local and build it. Once successfully build you need to copy basically two .dll file "Mindtree.Sitecore.ItemWebApi.Pipelines.dll" and "Mindtree.Sitecore.WebApi.Client.dll" to your target Sitecore instance's Bin directory. You also need to replace the "`\App_Config\Include\Sitecore.ItemWebApi.config". Remember this file was based on Sitecore 7.2 and than extended further. So if in any future version if this file get modified than you need to manually patch the config file with newly inducted config sections.(Explained in blog).

Can't I Simply have the Sitecore package which I can instal straight away ?
 Yes you can do so, please visit Sitecore marketplace and search for CoreSync, Under download you will find the zip based package which just had the service and config included. But remember if you directly install this on production server it will trigger the AppPool Refresh which may not be desired.
 
What are these .dll files?
Mindtree.Sitecore.ItemWebApi.Pipelines.dll : This library contains the enhanced code for extended Sitecore Item Web API.
Mindtree.Sitecore.WebApi.Client.dll : This library contains the .net wrapper which allow you to call the JSON/XML based service from any .net based application.

What is the role of this 'Mindtree.Sitecore.WebApiClient.Demo' ?
This project is a console application which provide possible implementations of the service using the .net wrapper stated above.


The Postfix in the title hint at new tool for which as of now I can't publish the code but tool itself will be available at Sitecore Marketplace. To read more about this tool and extended webservice please follow my blog http://insitecore.blogspot.com
