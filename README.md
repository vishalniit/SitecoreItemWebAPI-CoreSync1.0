# SitecoreItemWebAPI-CoreSync1.0
I enhanced the Sitecore Item WebAPI 1.2 to include few new features because Item Web API does not support create the versioned (Language or Numbered) item. The media item support is also not great with Item Web API. The biggest support I am looking was, what If, if I want to create an Item while retaining the Item ID on the new Sitecore System. Such can only happen through two ways in Sitecore one is Plain Serialization or itâ€™s another popular derivative which is Sitecore packaging.
Now to overcome these challenges I decide to extend the Item Web API in such a manner so that it can do lot more than what it made for. I hope community like this extention.
The Postfix in the title hint at new tool for which as of now I can't publish the code but tool itself will be available at Sitecore Marketplace. To read more about this tool and extended webservice please follow my blog http://insitecore.blogspot.com 
Please also point out issues and suggestion in order to optmize this thread.
